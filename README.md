# Hello IT Implementation
## Scripts for Hello IT 1.2.9

These scripts were built based on the current release version of [Hello IT by ygini](https://github.com/ygini/Hello-IT). Many of these scripts were adapted to work based on scripts by [wardsparadox](https://github.com/wardsparadox) and some by [smashism](https://github.com/smashism).

> I have anonymized aspects of this that pertain to my company resources to make this a more general guide to how I implemented Hello IT.
